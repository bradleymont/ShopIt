ShopIt is an app for users to efficiently locate items in a grocery store. Our mobile interface allows users to select a store, search for any item in the store, place their desired items in their cart, and pan around a map displaying the locations of all their carted items. Our web interface allows store owners to manage their stores by adding items, updating their floorplan map, and updating item locations through a drag-and-drop feature.

## How To Run
In order to run each component of ShopIt, please refer to their respective READMEs ([Mobile App](ShopItFrontend/README.md), [Web App](ShopItWeb/README.md), [Backend](ShopItBackend/README.md)). First, start the backend web server, and then run the mobile and web applications once the server is running.
