ShopIt is an app for users to locate items in a store. Our mobile interface allows users to select a store, search for any item in the store, place their desired items in their cart, and pan around a map displaying the locations of all their carted items. Our web interface allows store owners to manage their stores by adding items, updating their floorplan map, and updating item locations through a drag-and-drop feature.
