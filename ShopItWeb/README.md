# How to run

Install dependencies and start the web app: 
```
npm ci
npm start
```
## Instructions for creating a new store through the web app:

1. Create csv file with columns: name, brand, category, price, size. 
2. All items in csv file must contain values for these columns. 
 - You can alternatively use the sample.csv file in the ShopItBackend/test directory. 
3. If you want users to see images for each item, create a zip file that contains images. Each image file must have the same name of the item you want it to be associated with.
 - You can alternatively use the images.zip file in the ShopItBackend/test directory. 
4. Download an image of a grocery store's floor plan. Note: some floor plan images that are too small might not render correctly. 
  - You can alternatively use the floorPlan.png file in the ShopItBackend/test directory. 
5. On the web application, enter one of the following locations for stores. Other stores might not yet be supported by our team, but you can still try them.
